# A Note A Day :sparkles::sparkles:
Leave a special note that your loved one can read everyday.

A small project I made for my girlfriend for our long distance relationship.


:star: The idea is to write a special personalised note for your loved one everyday.<br>
:star: You can write notes for multiple days or just write the note for tomorrow it's up to you.<br>
:star: Once the notes are written the script will handle things.<br>
:star: You can also add a Anniversary Date to show `days of togetherness`
